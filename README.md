1. Project Objective
The goal of this project is to:
Create a Revenue Forecasting Dashboard: Unlocking Business potential in Power BI.
Analyze sales data to forecast quarterly revenue trends.
Help leadership make data-driven decisions to reduce stock shortages and optimize inventory.

2. Key Questions (KPIs)
The dashboard should answer the following key questions:
What is the total revenue?
What are the quarterly revenue trends?
Which products generate the highest revenue?
Which regions or countries contribute the most to revenue?
How is inventory performing (e.g., stock shortages, overstock)?
What is the forecasted revenue for the next quarter?

3. Process (Step-by-Step)
Data Preparation:
Load the dataset (e.g., Online Retail dataset).
Clean the data (remove cancelled orders, handle missing values).
Calculate revenue: Revenue = Quantity * UnitPrice.

Data Modeling:
Create a date table for time-based analysis.
Add measures (e.g., Total Revenue, Quarterly Revenue).

Dashboard Design:
Create visualizations:
Cards: Total revenue, quarterly revenue.
Line Chart: Quarterly revenue trends.
Bar Chart: Top products by revenue.
Bar Chart: Revenue by country.
Table: Stock performance.
Add filters and slicers (e.g., year, quarter, country).


4. Project Insights
Revenue Trends:
Quarterly revenue is increasing/decreasing, with seasonal spikes in Q4.
Top 10 Products:
Products A, B, and C generate the highest revenue.
Regional Performance:
The UK contributes the most to revenue, followed by Germany and France.
Inventory Issues:
Stock shortages are observed for high-demand products (e.g., Product X).
Forecast:
Revenue is expected to grow by X% in the next quarter.

5. Conclusion
The Revenue Forecasting Dashboard provides actionable insights into sales trends, product performance, and inventory management.
By identifying top-performing products and regions, leadership can optimize inventory strategies and reduce stock shortages.
The forecasting feature helps predict future revenue, enabling proactive decision-making.
The dashboard is interactive, user-friendly, and can be shared with stakeholders for data-driven decision-making.
